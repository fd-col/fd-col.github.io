## Computer Science degree and seasonal SUP instructor.

Enthusiastic, powerful, out of the box thinker. Always thirsting after something new. I am used to work both in detached or close-knit collaboration.

I have Computer Science and Automation degree in Polytechnic University of Marche achieved in 2023.

Then, I spent five months in Switzerland as an intern to follow up a project about Extended Reality (XR) for the Applied Intelligent Agents Lab (AISLab) which applies Intelligent Agent and Multi Agent techniques to healthcare.

Now, I am looking forward to undertake an international master about IT subjects that I am passionate about.
