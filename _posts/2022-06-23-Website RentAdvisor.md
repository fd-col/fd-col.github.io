# RentAdvisor website

RentAvdvisor website aims to create a bridge between students and rental owners.
A new user can quickly take a look at the home page and surf the available apartments and beds in the website. Moreover the user has the option to subscribe and access more dedicated operations.\\
In addition, the owner of a property can post an ad by doing the registration process or using the login.

Briefly, the student can message with the owner and request accomodation by specifing the period; while the owner can acept the request and stipulate a contract, as well as manage his ads in a personal page.

Apart of the mentioned student and owner access, there is a third account typology: the administrator of the website.\\
The administrator is the one who can access the website from an higher point of view with the possibility to generate statistics about the website usage and to modify the dedicated FAQ section.
