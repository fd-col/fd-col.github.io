# RentAdvisor

  RentAvdvisor is our website name. Its purpose is to create a bridge between customers, tipically students, and rental owners.
Basically, a new user can see the ads for apartments or beds in the home page. Then, is possible to subscribe and access more functionalities.

We have 3 different accounts typologies: the student, the owner and the administrator of the website.
Briefly, the student can message with the owner and request accomodation by specifing the period; while the owner can acept the request and stipulate a contract, as well as manage his ads in a personal page.
