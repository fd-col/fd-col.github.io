# IVR drills in Unity 3d

## Introduction


### Step 0
Getting used to Unity editor and implementing new basic features inside the demo 3d game.

### Step 1
Create a new project in order to improve fire and flood particle systems. The more realistc they are, the more engaging the drills will be. 

### Step 2
Import the particle systems created inside the [Mid Coast Hospital](https://www.midcoasthealth.com/) project, adjust it (change some graphics, organize folders) and optimize the coding section.

### Step 3
Implement NPC (non-playable-character) clever movement in the surrounding environment.
  
  1. avoid walls collision
  2. declare some not-walkable areas (stairs, rooftop border, clinical rooms, entrance walls)
  3. add a property to all doors (nav mesh obstacle) to stop collisons with them
  4. on emergency signal: change NPC's behaviour and escape the damage sources (fire, water)
  5. on emergency signal: follow the nearest emergency exits

### Step 4
Add a startmenu to select the hazard as well as future options.
